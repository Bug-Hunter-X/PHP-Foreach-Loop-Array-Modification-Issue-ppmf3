This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to handling array keys and references.  The problem lies in modifying an array element within a loop that iterates over the array itself using a foreach loop.  In PHP, foreach loops typically create copies of the array's values, but when you modify a value that's also a reference, it can lead to unexpected results.  This code tries to remove elements from an array while iterating through it.  The keys are expected to change while the loop is running leading to unexpected array indexes. 
```php
$myArray = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];
foreach ($myArray as $key => $value) {
    if ($value === 'c') {
        unset($myArray[$key]);
    }
}
print_r($myArray);
```
